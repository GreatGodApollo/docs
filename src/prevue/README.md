# Prevue

[Prevue][prv] (ESQ) was the software behind the Prevue Channel. Prevue ran on the Amiga platform. The software displays a grid
of channels and the current listings. Randomly learning about it from a friend, I decided to write a [CLI][genday] to help generate the 
listing files (`curday.dat`).
