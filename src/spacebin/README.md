# Spacebin

[Spacebin][spc] is text sharing for the final frontier. It's essentially a redesign of [haste][hst] in TypeScript,
using Svelte for the web interface, and Koa for the backend. I decided to build an [API client][lunar] & [library][api] for GoLang,
mostly because it's one of my favorite languages, but also because I needed a project.
